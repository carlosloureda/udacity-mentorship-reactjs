# Lyfecicle events

Example app to go through lyficle events and see them:

We shouldnt use a db fetch inside the render method, render method sould be free of sideeffects ...

- ComponentDidMount:
  Invoked inmediatly after the component is inserted into the DOM. Setting state in this method will trigger a re-rendering
- ComponentWillUnMount:
  Invoked inmediatly before the component is removed from the DOM
- getDerivedStateFromProps:
  Invoked after a component is instantiated as well as when it receives brand new props
- shouldComponentUpdate()
  You'll sometimes see in React apps as well. It returns true by default. This means that whenever a component's state (or its parent's state) is updated, the component re-renders

Consider using the built-in PureComponent instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate() by hand.
If your React componentâ€™s render() function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use [React.PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent) for a performance boost in some cases

Adding to the DOM
These lifecycle events are called when a component is being added to the DOM:

componentWillMount()
render()
componentDidMount()
Re-rendering
These lifecycle events are called when a component is re-rendered to the DOM

componentWillReceiveProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
componentWillUpdate()

Error Handling
These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

static getDerivedStateFromError()
componentDidCatch()
