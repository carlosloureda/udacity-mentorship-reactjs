# Contacts App

Needs to have a backend server also running ...

```
cd server
node server.js
# On another terminal
cd web
npm run start
```

## Rendering UI

Just set the ContactList inside the hello world default app created by `create-react-app` script

## State

3 new concepts of React:

- Props
- Funcional Components (before "stateless components")
- Controlled Components

## Lyfecycle Events

We shouldnt use a db fetch inside the render method, render method sould be free of sideeffects ...

- ComponentDidMount:
  Invoked inmediatly after the component is inserted into the DOM. Setting state in this method will trigger a re-rendering
- ComponentWillUnMount:
  Invoked inmediatly before the component is removed from the DOM
- getDerivedStateFromProps:
  Invoked after a component is instantiated as well as when it receives brand new props
- shouldComponentUpdate()
  You'll sometimes see in React apps as well. It returns true by default. This means that whenever a component's state (or its parent's state) is updated, the component re-renders

Consider using the built-in PureComponent instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate() by hand.
If your React component’s render() function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use [React.PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent) for a performance boost in some cases

## React Router

SPA definition

React Router

React Router turns React projects into single-page applications. It does this by providing a number of specialized components that manage the creation of links, manage the app's URL, provide transitions when navigating between different URL locations, and so much more.

#### Browser Router

Listen for changes on the URl and shows the proper screen when URL changes

#### The Link Component

The way the user navigates through the app

#### Route Component

If the path matches an URL it takes to the correct screen
