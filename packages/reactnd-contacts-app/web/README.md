# Contacts App
Needs to have a backend server also running ...
```
cd server
node server.js
# On another terminal
cd web
npm run start
```

## Rendering UI
Just set the ContactList inside the hello world default app created by `create-react-app` script

## State

3 new concepts of React:

- Props 
- Funcional Components (before "stateless components")
- Controlled Components
