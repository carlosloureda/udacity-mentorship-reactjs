## Learn TypeScript & React with [Typescript-react-almendra]()

From the official site, lets play and learn TypeScript with [TS-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter#typescript-react-starter).
With this project we will have:

- a project with React and TypeScript
- linting with TSLint
- testing with Jest and Enzyme, and
- state management with Redux

If you want to create-react-app you just can use: `create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts`
