    <h4>Some comments about paths</h4>

    <article>
        <p>You'll soon make a website that displays an image that is stored locally on your computer. In order to
            display a
            local image, you need to be able to write a path.</p>

        <p>If there is a file called index.html in a directory and there is another directory called example/ in the
            same
            directory, you can access any files in example/ from index.html with the URL (path) example/filename.html,
            e.g.
            <a href="example/filename.html">Example Path</a>.</p>

        <h1>Paths</h1>
        <p>A path is a way of describing where a file is stored.</p>

        <p>Think of it like this:</p>

        <p>Anyone in the world can use the address 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington DC, USA 20006 to find the White
            House. A street address is an absolute path to a location.</p>

        <p>But, if you were at the Eisenhower Executive Office, you could also use the phrase "next door" to find the
            White
            House. "Next door" is a relative path because it depends on your current location.</p>

        <p>There are essentially two domains for paths that you'll need to consider as a web developer: paths to find
            files
            on your computer, local files, and paths to find files on other computers, external files.</p>

        <h2>Local Paths</h2>
        <p>Computers have folders (also called "directories"). Operating systems like Windows, Mac and Linux organize
            all of your files into a tree of directories called a file system. There's a top-most directory, often
            called
            the root, that contains all of the other directories. Within the root, there are files and directories.
            Within
            those directories are more files and more directories. And within those directories are even more files and
            directories, and so on.</p>
